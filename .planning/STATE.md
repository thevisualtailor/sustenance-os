## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Vite + vanilla JS (no framework) — match Compound OS exactly, no React
- Claude Haiku as default AI model — pennies/day cost target
- OCR via Claude Vision — no dedicated OCR service, Claude reads MacroFactor natively
- No auth — single user (Jay), complexity not warranted
- Fire meals seeded from existing fire-meals.md — 50+ meals already documented
