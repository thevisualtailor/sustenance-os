## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | User can open the app from the iPhone home screen with no browser chrome visible | VERIFIED | Human-confirmed by Jay with screenshots. `index.html` has `apple-mobile-web-app-capable: yes` and `status-bar-style: black-translucent`. Manifest has `display: standalone`. Plan 02 Task 3 (blocking checkpoint) was approved by user. |
| 2 | App loads on Vercel production URL and is reachable from any device | VERIFIED | Production URL `https://sustenance-os.vercel.app` confirmed live in SUMMARY. Build exits 0, produces valid `dist/`. `vercel.json` SPA rewrite in place. GitHub auto-deploy connected. |
| 3 | Layout is mobile-first and finger-friendly — no horizontal scrolling, no tiny tap targets | VERIFIED | `main.css` has `overflow-x: hidden` on both `html` and `body`. `.app-main` max-width 600px, centered. Tap target rule: `button, a, [role="button"] { min-height: 44px; min-width: 44px; }`. `@media (max-width: 480px)` breakpoint present. |
| 4 | Visual style matches Compound OS (dark theme, Geist + Roboto Mono, CSS variables) | VERIFIED | `main.css` `:root` block has `--bg: #0a0a0a`, full color palette. `@font-face` declarations for all 4 Geist weights. Roboto Mono loaded via Google Fonts. Instrument Serif loaded for headings. CSS variables used throughout. |
| 5 | App shell renders header and main content area | VERIFIED | `app-shell.js` exports `createAppShell(root)` which creates `<header class="app-header">` with h1 "Sustenance OS" and `<main class="app-main">`. Returns `{ header, main }`. Wired in `main.js`. |
| 6 | User can add Sustenance OS to iPhone home screen via Share > Add to Home Screen | VERIFIED | All required artifacts present: `apple-mobile-web-app-capable` meta tag, `apple-touch-icon` link, manifest with `display: standalone`. Human-verified by Jay at Task 3 checkpoint. |
| 7 | Home screen icon displays a recognizable app icon (not a blank/default square) | VERIFIED | `public/apple-touch-icon.png` exists (490 bytes — valid PNG). `public/pwa-192x192.png` (542 bytes), `public/pwa-512x512.png` (1875 bytes). Generated by `scripts/generate-icons.js` as dark #0a0a0a PNGs. Human confirmed icon appeared on home screen. |
| 8 | Status bar blends with the dark theme (black-translucent) | VERIFIED | `index.html` has `<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style" content="black-translucent" />` and `<meta name="theme-color" content="#0a0a0a" />`. Human-confirmed in iPhone test. |

**Score:** 8/8 truths verified

| `public/pwa-192x192.png` | 192x192 PNG icon | VERIFIED | EXISTS, 542 bytes (well above 100-byte minimum). |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|----|-----|--------|---------|
| `index.html` | `src/main.js` | `<script type="module" src="/src/main.js">` | WIRED | Line 19 of index.html confirmed. |
| `src/main.js` | `src/view/app-shell.js` | `import { createAppShell }` | WIRED | Line 2 import confirmed. `createAppShell` called on line 6. |
| `src/main.js` | `src/styles/main.css` | `import './styles/main.css'` | WIRED | Line 1 confirmed. |
| `src/styles/main.css` | `public/fonts/geist/` | `@font-face url('/fonts/geist/...')` | WIRED | All 4 weights declared with `/fonts/geist/` paths — avoids node_modules breakage in production. |
| `vite.config.js` | `public/pwa-192x192.png` | manifest icons array | WIRED | `src: '/pwa-192x192.png'` in manifest icons. `src: '/pwa-512x512.png'` for maskable. |
| `index.html` | `public/apple-touch-icon.png` | `<link rel="apple-touch-icon">` | WIRED | Line 10 of index.html: `<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/apple-touch-icon.png" />` |
| `index.html` | `apple-mobile-web-app-capable` | meta tag | WIRED | Lines 7–9: all three apple meta tags present. |

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| APP-01 (PWA installable on iPhone) | SATISFIED | Meta tags, manifest, icons, service worker all present. Human-verified. |
| APP-02 (Vercel production URL, reachable any device) | SATISFIED | `https://sustenance-os.vercel.app` live. GitHub auto-deploy connected. SPA rewrite in vercel.json. |
| APP-03 (Mobile-first, finger-friendly layout) | SATISFIED | `overflow-x: hidden`, `max-width: 600px`, 44px tap targets, 480px breakpoint. |

---

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Pattern | Severity | Assessment |
|------|---------|----------|------------|
| `src/main.js` lines 8–21 | Uses class name `app-placeholder` | INFO | This is correct scaffold placeholder content — not a stub. The placeholder renders real text ("Sustenance OS", "Your BED-safe nutrition coach") and proves the shell works. It is the intended Phase 1 state, to be replaced in Phase 2 with the chat UI. |

No blockers. No stub implementations. No TODO/FIXME comments in any source file.

---

### Build Verification

`npm run build` output (run during verification):

- Exit: 0 (clean)
- 5 modules transformed
- `dist/manifest.webmanifest` — contains `"display":"standalone"`, `"name":"Sustenance OS"`, dark theme colors
- `dist/sw.js` — generated by vite-plugin-pwa in generateSW mode
- `dist/workbox-8c29f6e4.js` — Workbox runtime
- 14 entries precached (187.77 KiB including fonts, icons, JS, CSS)

---

### Human Verification

**Status: COMPLETED by user (Jay)**

The following were verified by a human on a real iPhone device. The Plan 02 Task 3 checkpoint was a blocking gate that required user approval before the plan was marked complete. User typed "approved" after confirming all criteria.

Items confirmed:
1. App opens from iPhone home screen in standalone mode (no URL bar, no tabs, no Safari navigation buttons)
2. Home screen icon displayed (not a blank square)
3. Status bar blends with dark background (black-translucent)
4. Dark-themed scaffold with "Sustenance OS" header visible
5. No horizontal scrolling, layout fills screen properly

Screenshots were provided by the user confirming standalone mode working correctly.

---

### Summary

Phase 1 goal is fully achieved. All 8 must-have truths verified — 7 via automated code inspection, 1 (PWA standalone behavior) via human confirmation at the Task 3 blocking checkpoint. The codebase is a genuine, working scaffold: the build is clean, all key links are wired, no stubs or placeholder implementations exist in the infrastructure layer. The placeholder content in `src/main.js` is correct for Phase 1 (it proves the shell renders) and is the designated insertion point for Phase 2's chat UI.

The foundation is ready for Phase 2 (Chat UI).
